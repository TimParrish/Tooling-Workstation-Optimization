### VsCode

You can find the .settings.json file in this repo and look at the settings that I like to run on VsCode. If you have trouble locating your settings.json file, you can find the [operating system specific path and other usefull settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)

Some usuful shortcuts in VsCode:

* Opens settings
  * Mac OsX: Cmd + ,
  * Windows: Ctrl + ,
* How to change settings using the 'old style' json editor instead of the new UI settings editor
  * Open the settings
  * Workbench -> Editor management -> Settings editor -> change the dropdown from 'ui' to 'json'
  * Workbench -> Editor management -> Settings editor -> check the option for 'use split json'
