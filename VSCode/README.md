### VsCode

You can find the .settings.json file in this repo and look at the settings that I like to run on VsCode. If you have trouble locating your settings.json file, you can find the operating system specific path and other usefull settings in [THIS LINK](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)

Some usuful shortcuts in VsCode:

- Opens settings
  _ Mac OsX: Cmd + ,
  _ Windows: Ctrl + ,
- How to change settings using the 'old style' json editor instead of the new UI settings editor
  _ Open the settings
  _ Workbench -> Editor management -> Settings editor -> change the dropdown from 'ui' to 'json'
  _ Workbench -> Editor management -> Settings editor -> check the option for 'use split json'
